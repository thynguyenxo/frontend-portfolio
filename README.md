# Introduction
This repository contains mostly static webpages that I built without or with minimal JavaScript. My main focus here is to improve my HTML and CSS skills through the projects I've completed. This repository is a work in progress as I'm working through different front-end projects.

Below are examples of some projects that I have done:
* [Introduction](#introduction)
  * [Single price grid](#single-price-grid)
  * [Testimonials grid section](#testimonials-grid-section)
  * [Product preview card component](#product-preview-card-component)
